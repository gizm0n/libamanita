/** The aObject-class implements a smple RTTI-interface. Any class inheriting this class
 * must also implement a certain structure, which is managed with two very simple to
 * use macros.
 * 
 * Note that at the moment multiple inheritance if not supported. It's possible though
 * to have multiple inheritance with classes not inheriting the aObject class.
 *
 * When inheriting this class, it is very important that you include the
 * aObject_Instance macro in your class definition and the aObject_Inheritance macro
 * in the source file somewhere.
 * 
 * All classes that inherit the aObject class and adds these macros will have one ststic aClass instance
 * attached to the class, and one virtual method that returns the static aClass instance specific for
 * that class. This way no extra data is needed when creating objects to store RTTI-data, and very
 * little overhead is added.
 * 
 * So, whenever you need to make some test to see if one class inherits another or similar,
 * all you need to do is call a virtual method that returns a static aClass instance. As you see
 * it's pretty quick.
 *
 * Here's an example of how you can check inheritance and even get the name of the class
 * or the name of the class this class inherits from, and all classes inheriting from this class:
 * @code

/** A class for randomly generating words.
 * 
 * This class generates words randomly, that can be used for names even producing pseudo
 * languages. The generated words can be of any chosen length, and tries to mimic natural
 * language so that they can be pronounced, with a normal variation of nouns and vocals.
 * 
 * Any parameters in the generation of words can be set so that specific combinations
 * of letters are produced, to allow for variations between different languages. For
 * example; one language may contain lots of nouns and unusual combinations like "kk",
 * while other languages may use many vocals and vocal combinations like "ae".

/** A class that generates pseudorandom numbers.
 * 
 * The algorithm is inspired by mersenne twister, but differs in some ways. It is designed
 * to be fast, before generating perfect randomness, though the entropy values measured are
 * relatively good.
 * 
 * From the seed is generated a sequence of 256 integer numbers with a decent randomness and
 * place in the table. For generation of new random numbers are used two more variables; "num"
 * and "index". "Index" is an unsigned integer of the random_t-type that counts forward +1 for
 * every generated number. This ensures we avoid getting stuck in loops. "Num" is also an
 * unsigned integer of type random_t, it is always the value of the previously generated number.
 * When generating a new number we take two numbers in the table, add num to the second
 * number and xor them together. The result is placed in the address of the first number.
 * The code for this algorithm looks like this:
 * @code
table[index&0xff] ^= table[num&0xff] + num;
num = table[index&0xff];
index = index +1;
 * @endcode
 * It isn't more complicated than this, and yet it generates quite a good result compared to other
 * random number generators. A comparsion can be made here:
 * http://www.cacert.at/cgi-bin/rngresults
 * 
 * Actually, given a sufficently great enough amount of random data it seems to top the list,
 * but even a smaller amount of data places Random at a good spot.
 * 
 * How to use the class is extremely simple. There is a global instance of Random that may
 * be used anywhere where amanita/Random.h is included. It is named "rnd". You may also
 * instantiate Random as an object to keep track of the number sequence, and to make certain
 * it's not affected somewhere else in the program, because this could easily happen with the
 * global rnd.
 * 
 * Instantiating Random has it advantages in games for example, wher you perhaps want to ensure
 * that a certain sequence of random events always happens within a specific game, to avoid that
 * the player saves and loads and saves and loads to gain advantages. By storing Random with the
 * save file ensures exactly the same random sequence through the entire game, if following the
 * same paths. Of course, doing something else may trigger some other event or sequence of events,
 * but that's perhaps the way it should be? When situations like this are not called for, rnd
 * works very well.
 * 
 * To ge a random number, simply call any of the given methods, depending on what type of value
 * you require. The most commonly used method is perhaps uint32(), that generates an unsigned
 * 32 bits integer. There are some methods specific for games, board games or role-playing games.
 * 
 * Here is one example of how to get a random int:
 * @code
int i = rnd.int32();
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Here's an example on how to store and restore an instance of Random:
 * @code
Random r; // Sets seed to time(0).
FILE *fp = fopen("random.dat","wb");
r.write(fp);
fclose(fp);

... // Do romething with r.

fp = fopen("random.dat","rb");
r.read(fp); // Reads r to be exactly the same as when saved.
fclose(fp);
 * @endcode
 * @ingroup amanita

	 * Look at this example for a better understanding:
	 * @code
	 * uint32_t table[] = { 2,4,7,2,4,9,0 };
	 * uint32_t i = rnd.rollTable(table);
	 * @endcode

	 *    -1. 2-5
	 *    -2. 6-12
	 *    -3. 13-14
	 *    -4. 15-18
	 *    -5. 19-27

	 * If n>0, then the table can contain values of 0, and that only means the empty table cells

	 * uint32_t table[] = { 8,3,0,4,1,7,0,2,0 };
	 * uint32_t i = rnd.rollTable(table,25);

	 * The sum of the values in the list should not be larger than 0xFFFFFFFF.
	 * @param n The sum of values in the table. If set to 0, n is calculated to be the sum of all values of t.
	 * @param l Length of the table. If n is set to a value >0, then l can be omitted, because

	 * values in t until it reaches a 0 and set l to this.
	 * @return The index of the rolled values in the table, ranging from 0-(l-1).

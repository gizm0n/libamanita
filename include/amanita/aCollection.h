 * The aCollection-class is the top-class for all types of collections.
 * I decided creating my own set of Container-classes simply because of learning the algorithms and keeping
 * to my principal idea of making everything by hand. I consider programming an artform, so I had no intention
 * of making the most efficient or "best" choice, but simply making as much as possible handmade. Also, I
 * dislike templates because I find them ugly and I wanted my set of aCollection-classes to contain any types
 * and still be relatively type-safe. These classes do work fine and have been thoroughly tested, of course
 * they could be optimized, but that is an ongoing project.
 *
 * The aCollection-class is more or less an abstract class, even though it has no pure virtual methods at the time.
 * It extends the aObject-class so it can be implemented in the class-hierarchy of that class. All subclasses of
 * aCollection obviously has to implement the aObject-class style to maintain rtti-structure, though not doing so
 * only means pointing to the super-class aClass instead.

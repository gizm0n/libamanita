/** The aObject-class is the top-class of all objects that need to be defined within a class-structure with
 * a simple RTTI-interface.
 * 
 * When inheriting this class, it is very important that you include the RttiObjectInheritance macro in
 * your class definition and the other one in the source file somewhere.
 * 
 * All classes that inherit the aObject class and adds these macros will have one ststic aClass instance
 * attached to the class, and one virtual method that returns the static aClass instance specific for
 * that class. This way no extra data is needed when creating objects to store RTTI-data, and very
 * little overhead is added.
 * 
 * So, whenever you need to make some test to see if one class inherits another or similar,
 * all you need to do is call a virtual method that returns a static aClass instance. As you see
 * it's pretty quick.

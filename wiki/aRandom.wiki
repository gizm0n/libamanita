This is a fairly fast pseudorandom number generator with good enough entropy values. Please visit [http://www.cacert.at/cgi-bin/rngresults www.cacert.at] to compare results with other PRNGs (Pseudo Random Number Generator) and you will find it if you search for "aRandom 1.01".

The algorithm is inspired by the mersenne twister, and the focus is to make a fast generator more than to accomplish perfect randomness.

Except for the speed, one advantage this generator has compared to others is that it only requires 1036 bytes of memory (on a 32 bit processor, and 2072 on a 64 bit processor), per instance, and the data is stored within the class. So the complete sequence can be stored in a file, not only the seed, but any step within the sequence. This can be used in games for example, where you want to keep a persistent random sequence of events and avoid that the player saves, loads and get another random sequence.

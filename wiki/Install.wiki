=Installation of Amanita Library=
Here follows instructions on how to compile and install on different platforms.

==Linux==
===The Linux way===
To download, compile and install on *linux*, open a terminal and run the following sequence of commands:
{{{
sudo aptitude update
sudo aptitude install build-essential \
   libsdl1.2-dev \
   libsdl-net1.2-dev \
   libsdl-ttf2.0-dev \
   libsdl-image1.2-dev \
   libsqlite3-dev

cd ~/Desktop
svn checkout http://libamanita.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ libamanita
cd libamanita

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

cd ..
rm -r libamanita
}}}


==Windows==
===The MSYS way===
For *windows* users, it's the same principles, therer are two alternatives. Either, if you install MinGW and MSYS, you can use the autotools and then you will have to install the dependencies manually. You can find everything you need here:
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files

 http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php

 http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net

 http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf

 http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image

 http://www.sqlite.org/download.html

===The Dev-C++ way===
The other alternative, that is slightly more simple, is to use the available Devpaks for the libraries SDL-1.2, SDL_net, SDL_ttf, SDL_image and sqlite3 that you can find here:
 http://devpaks.org/

You can use Devpaks with any MinGW distribution, including Dev-C++, Code::Blocks etc. In fact, there is a libamanita.dev file in the repository that opens a project in Dev-C++. You may find and download Dev-C++ here:

Djynn is a plugin for the Geany IDE and adds sorting and commenting functionality as well as a simple projectmanager. It is designed entirely to fulfill my own needs, and is supplied as is.

At present time, Djynn adds adds functions for commenting, which Geany already has, but I found Geany's behaviour different to my liking, and so made my own routines. It will toggle line- and block-commenting, and add doxygen comments, and shortcuts can be made for quick access. Djynn also can sort lines in various ways, ascending, descending and reverse line order.

Djynn's Project manager inserts a tree for the project files, and a sorted list of open files for quick access if you have many open files.
